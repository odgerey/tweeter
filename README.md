# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is responsive with desktop, tablet and mobile views. This project tested our front-end knowledge covering HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX using Node, Express and MongoDB on the back-end. Moment was used to add the real-time functionality and enhance user experience. 

The like, flag and retweet buttons do not work. There are no other known bugs.
